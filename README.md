# Project Laboratory: Panda Plaza

This is a tile-based game where the players are controlling Orangutans in a plaza and they need to catch the Pandas. But beware, some pandas are sleepy and would fall asleep if they see a sofa or they might stop eating at the vending machine.
The game was a joint project of four software engineers and we implemented it in a couple of weeks from the graphics to the game logic.
